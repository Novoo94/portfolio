        About Me!
        </h1>
        <h2 id='bio'>I am always eager to learn new things, even if it means staring
            from the bottom. I am the first female in my Mexican family
            that has graduated from highschool! My dog and family is the reason why i want to
            keep on learning, and being prepared! Apart from studying I like to keep myself active,
            either I am walking my dog, passing the volleyball,, doing arts and crafts, making tiktoks,
            or spending time with my friends and family
